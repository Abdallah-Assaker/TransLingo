## Project Overview

The Translator Client provides a user interface for accessing translation functionalities. Users can input text and receive translations. (You can expand this section with more specific details about your project's goals and functionalities).

## Features

*   (Add key features of your translator client, e.g., Text input for translation)
*   (e.g., Language selection)
*   (e.g., Display of translated text)
*   Custom 404 page

## Tech Stack

*   **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
*   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **(Add other key technologies or libraries used, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Zustand, etc.)**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd translator-client
    ```
    If you've downloaded the code directly, navigate to the `translator-client` directory.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the application in development mode, typically available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

This command creates an optimized production build of your application in the `.next` folder.

## Running in Production Mode

After building the project, you can start the application in production mode:

Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will serve the optimized build.

## Project Structure

The `translator-client` project follows a standard Next.js (App Router) structure:

```
translator-client/
├── app/                  # Main application directory (App Router)
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx          # Main homepage
│   ├── not-found.tsx     # Custom 404 page
│   └── ...               # Other routes and components
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── src/                  # Optional: Alternative source directory
│   ├── assets/           # Project assets like images, icons
│   │   └── image/
│   │       └── Na_Nov_26.jpg
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (if you create this folder)
│   └── ...
├── .eslintrc.json        # ESLint configuration
├── next.config.mjs       # Next.js configuration (or .js)
├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md             # This file
```

*   **`app/`**: Contains all the routes, layouts, and UI components specific to pages. Next.js uses a file-system based router within this directory.
*   **`public/`**: Static files that are served directly, like favicons or images not processed by Webpack.
*   **`src/assets/`**: (As inferred from your `not-found.tsx`) Contains static assets like images that are imported into components. The `@` alias in imports often points to `src/` or the project root.
*   **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and defines scripts for running, building, and testing the application.
